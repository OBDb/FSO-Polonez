    description: "The FSO Polonez was a Polish-built hatchback based on the chassis and mechanical components of the Fiat 125p (Polski Fiat), but featuring a completely new hatchback body designed with input from Giorgetto Giugiaro. Initially available only as a five-door hatchback, the Polonez represented a modernization effort for the Polish automotive industry. Powered primarily by a range of gasoline engines derived from Fiat designs, including 1.3L and 1.5L units with modest outputs, it featured a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout that was becoming outdated compared to western competitors. The interior was basic and utilitarian, with simple controls and durable materials designed for the challenging economic conditions of Eastern Bloc countries. Despite its technical limitations, the Polonez offered practical transportation with reasonable space efficiency and became a symbol of Polish industry during the late Communist era. Various special editions and improvements were introduced throughout this period, though development was constrained by limited resources and economic challenges."

    description: "Following the fall of communism and Poland's transition to a market economy, the Polonez received its first major update with the Caro variant. The exterior featured updated styling with new front and rear fascias, improved bumpers, and better finish quality. The lineup expanded to include pickup truck, van, and cargo variants alongside the standard hatchback. Engine options evolved to include Rover-sourced 1.4L K-series engines and later more modern power units including a 1.6L Volkswagen diesel engine in some variants. The interior saw improvements in design, materials, and equipment levels, though still lagging behind Western European competitors. Safety enhancements included the addition of front disc brakes and eventually features like airbags in later models. The Atu sedan variant introduced in 1996 offered a traditional three-box design to appeal to more conservative buyers. Despite continuous updates, the Polonez's outdated platform and increasing competition from used Western cars and new budget vehicles like the Daewoo Lanos led to declining sales. Production finally ended in 2002, marking the conclusion of Poland's most significant domestically developed passenger car, with over 1.5 million units produced across all generations."
